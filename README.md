# Capstone Project: Exploring the Global Mental Health Situation

## Overview
This Capstone Project focuses on analyzing and visualizing global data related to mental health, with a specific focus on depression, anxiety, and suicide rates. Utilizing the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset spanning from 1990 to 2019 and multiple surveys. Our objective is to identify and understand trends, patterns, risk factors, and impacts associated with mental health disorders and suicide across different regions, groups and years. 

## Project Description
Our project aims to raise awareness, promote understanding, and encourage meaningful action, and support to improve mental well-being and address the challenges and complexities associated with mental health on a global scale.

## Process
1. Data Collection
First we found Datasets on the website ourworldindata.org, but with further investigation to this topic we were able to acquire the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset containing information on all mental diseases, suicide rates, and related measures from 1990 to 2019. To look closer on an individual level we decided to have a look on social media, cantral ladder score, subjective income vs history of depression, availability and affordability of mental health professionals, and social connection / loneliness. For the sub-topics we analyzed different surveys, the biggest one was the Wellcome Global Questionaire with 119.000 entries. 
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Cleaned, processed, and prepared the dataset to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability for analysis and visualization in Tableau.
3. Data Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis, trend analysis, and comparative analysis within VS-Code using Python to uncover insights, correlations, associations, and patterns related to mental health disorders and suicide.
4. Data Management
To efficiently manage our datasets and collaborate as a team, we stored them in a PostgreSQL database and accessed, pushed, and pulled our data using a Python connection and engine.
5. Visualization
Developed compelling and informative visualizations, including line charts, bar and column charts, heat maps, bubble charts, tree map, scatter plots, and interactive dashboards. To present and communicate the analyzed data and insights effectively and engage with the audience.
6. Presentation
For our presentation we collected all our informative charts into Canva and then build a storyline upon that. Feel free to check out our final presentation on YouTube here:

## Key Objectives
- Analyze and interpret trends, patterns, and changes in mental disorders and suicide rates globally and across different regions, countries, and demographic groups.
- Identify leading risk factors, causes, and impacts associated with mental health disorders and suicide and explore their contributions to the overall burden of disease. 
- Develop informative, compelling, and engaging visualizations and presentations to raise awareness, educate, inform, and inspire action on mental health and mental well-being.

## Key Outcome
Contribute to mental health research, promoting mental well-being, resilience and supporting the efforts to reduce the global burden of mental health disorders and suicide.
